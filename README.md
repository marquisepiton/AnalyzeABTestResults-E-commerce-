# AnalyzeABTestResults-E-commerce-
In this project, I will analyze the results for two e-commerce websites
Scenario: The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. This project will focus on statistical and probability computing.
